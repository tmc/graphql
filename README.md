graphql
=======

utilities for dealing with GraphQL queries in Go.

This package focuses on actually creating GraphQL servers and expects you to describe your schema directly in Go.

To that end this library initially has not emphasized GraphQL schema definition parsing and instead focuses on Query Documents and writing real servers.
